My personal repository

I live in Belgium since 2016. 
In my country I used to work in the field of tourism and development, 
I hold a masterâ€™s degree in Social Development in The Graduate Institute of Geneva in Switzerland (2008),
I moved to Belgium following my wife who is a student at KU Leuven,  because we are a family we moved together to this country,
but due to my migratory condition, I'm not allowed to work, I'm just allowed to study, in the past I tried to access to higher education but I was ignore for most of the schools, but I was accepted at Ecole technique Agnes Varda to study photography. 
last year I was accepted to study a master degree in visual culture at UCL, 
but this is not enough,
I would like to complete my process of integration, I think the IT market is growing fast and there is a high demand for programmers, 
I think that trought the access to the work market I can finally complete my integration. 
in the future I would like to mix art photography, social development and digital technology doing colaborative work with communities and associations. 
I like all kind of outdoor activities, from trekking to Bodyboarding.  
You can find me in Leuven, If you are in my city write me a message, we can drik a coffe and I can show you the city.
